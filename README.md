# Calculator
So this is my calculator and my first python project and I used the youtube video to learn how to do everything and online resources for specific math help. 
With this program you can do addition using +, subtraction using -, multiplication using *, division using /, make something to the power of something else using power, you can square root something using sqrt, you can do exp using exp, you can do log using log, you can do log2 using log2, you can do log10 by doing log10, you can do sin by doing sin, cos by doing cos, tan by doing tan, you can find the slope of a line by doing slope, you can find the parallel of a line that goes through certain points by doing parallel, you can find the perpendicular of a line that goes through certain points by doing perpendicular, and you can also type help to see all of the options.   
In all of these you can replace the number with pi or e using the words pi or e. You can also decimals or negative numbers if you so choose.
First it will prompt you to enter an operator which you choose from the list above, then you enter in the number or numbers depending on what it is.
Once you are done with your calculation it will ask you if you'd like to repeat and if you type Yes it will start again.
If you type no it will say "Ok, thank you for calculating today!" then it will end the program.
All of the typing is case sensitive so please write it how I wrote it.
